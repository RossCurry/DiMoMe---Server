DiMoMe (digital mobile menu)  is a web app designed for any restaurant, bar or coffeeshop owners. The app aims to be a platform that provides easy access for customers to view digital menus in a comfortable to use format, readable on mobile devices, even allowing customers to filter products for allergens.

Since 2016 the EU has made it a requirement for any eatery to provide information on allergens and intolerances, not just on the request of the customer. DiMoMe provides an useful solution to this problem, as well as taking into account the effects of Covid-19 in the sector, like not sharing menus. 

Furthermore the use of DiMoMe will lead to savings in menu print costs. It's a win for customers and restauranteurs alike.

##  **Server**

Welcome to the server repo for DiMoMe. If you are looking for the **client setup**, you can find it [here](https://github.com/RossCurry/DiMoMe---client).

### **Tech Stack**

On the backend for this project I used:

[Express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html): for the server.

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): as a database.

[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/): as an ORM.

[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/): as an image API. They handle all the image storage.

### **Getting Started**

**Cloudinary** requires an account to receive an API key which will be necessary to get things up an running. Don't worry, as they have a decent free tier account. Visit [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) here.

### **Environment Variables**

There is an env.examples file to help point you in the right direcction of any missing environment variables

### **Installation - steps to install**

To get things running, first clone this repo: https://github.com/RossCurry/DiMoMe---Server

Then from the server folder install all dependencies:

`npm i`

To get the server running

`npm start`

For development I highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) globally and using the `nodemon` command.

As long as you have your MongoDB setup that should get everything up and running.

Once the server is going you can start your client. Check out the repo here: https://github.com/RossCurry/DiMoMe---client.
